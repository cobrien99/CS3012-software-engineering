# Feng-hsiung Hsu: Deep Blue, deep impact

Feng-hsiung Hsu is a computer scientist whose pioneering work on artificial intelligence redefined what we thought computers were capable of.
His crowning achievement was his work as the lead designer of the IBM Deep Blue chess computer, the first computer to win a chess match against a reigning world chess champion.
This was no small feat and required Hsu and his team to push the boundaries of what was technologically capable at the time.
 Hsu was ultimately successful, although the journey was full of setbacks and tribulations along the way. Hsu demonstrated the potential of artificial intelligence to the whole world, and in my opinion, heralded all the innovative AI research going on today.
 
 # Setting up the board: the early life of Feng-hsiung Hsu
 
 Hsu was born in Taiwan where he earned his Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering. His passion for computer chess was born when he stumbled across the book "Chess Skill in Man and Machine" while in college. 
 Hsu’s interest was piqued but had to be put on hold while he completed 2 years of military service. Afterwards Hsu came to the United states, to study computer chip design at Carnegie Melon University (CMU). However, a chance meeting with another computer chess enthusiast, Ken Thompson, would change Hsu’s life forever.
  Today Thompson is known for inventing Unix but more important to this story Thompson was the creator of the Belle, which at time was one of the world’s best chess playing machines. While impressive for its time, the Belle would never defeat a grandmaster. Hsu studied the Belle and to the shock of Thompson, discovered an architectural flaw with the Belle.
 You see the Belles system was thought to be too large to fit on a single chip, thus it had to be split across multiple chips which lead to a decrease in performance. However, Hsu employed some clever tricks and managed to cram the entire Belle system onto one chip.
 
 # From Pawn to Queen: the road to Deep Blue
 Armed with this knowledge, Hsu began to dream about what would be possible if he designed his own chess computer from the ground up and implemented these changes from the beginning. Easier said than done, as CMU already had a team working on the next generation of the Belle. If Hsu began work on his own machine, he would risk earning the ire of his fellow computer scientists and, even worse, risk getting kicked out from CMU.
 Hsu believed this was his one shot at making history and so began working secretly on his own chess computer. He christened his chess computer *Deep Thought*, a playful nod to the supercomputer of the same name in Douglas Adams, *A Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy*. Hsu worked covertly for six months. The results, in my opinion, were astounding.
 The Belle was spread across four chips and capable of searching 60,000 nodes per second whereas *Deep Thought* could search up two million nodes per second, __all on a single chip__!  Hsu presented his forbidden machine to CMU, who could hardly argue with results. The Belle project was scrapped, and the team was set to work on *Deep Thought* instead, with Hsu at the projects helm.
 
 # Sneak attack: unveiling *Deep Thought* on the worlds stage
With CMUs backing, *Deep Thought* was finally ready to play its first tournament with actual humans. Hsu had his sights set on a big target: the US Open. There *Deep Thought* would get to play against its first grandmaster, a man named Igor Ivanoff. It was, in Hsus own words: "A sneak attack on the chess world".

Ivanoff was a seasoned and confident player who had played plenty of machines already. Ivanoff was so confident in fact that he was reading a magazine during the early part of the game. More like overconfident. By move 19 he put down his magazine, by move 29 he resigned. No one, not even Hsu, expected that. 

That fateful game was akin to opening Pandoras Box. All at once, the spotlight was on Hsu. He was getting offers from rival universities, private companies and even the US military. A far cry from the man who had to work in secret during his free time.

 # Checkmate: *Deep Blue* vs Kasparov
 
 Hsu and his team decided to leave CMU and work with IBM. Hsu was interested in IBM because they were a world leader in artificial intelligence and IBM was interested in the *Deep Thought* project because of the possible commercial applications of this technology, and of course the prestige that would come from beating the world champion.
 
 This doesn't mean that the transition from CMU to IBM was painless, Quite the opposite in fact. Hsu was used to working with college students who were dedicated and would work long hours. This contrasts with the programmers at IBM who were strictly 9 to 5. Another problem was that Hsu often had to fight with IBM to get the appropriate resources for his project.
 
For copyright reasons, Hsu couldn't continue to call his machine *Deep Thought* so it was renamed *Deep Blue*, a reference to IBMs nickname "Big Blue".

Hsu and his team worked on *Deep Blue* for over 7 years before Hsu felt confident enough to challenge the current world champion, Garry Kasparov.
The kind of artificial intelligence used in *Deep Blue* is known as symbolic artificial intelligence. This involved using brute force to find the best possible move in each scenario. This approach differs to deep learning and neural networks that are prevalent in AI today but at the time these approaches weren't practical given the processing power at the time.

After 7 years of tweaking and iterating, *Deep Blue* was able to compute 200 million moves per second, or 50 billion in the three minutes that are allocated for a single move in a professional chess game. At this stage *Deep Blue* typically looked around 8 moves ahead but could look even 20 or more moves ahead in tricky situations. Finally, *Deep Blue* was ready to challenge the champion himself.

The match was to take place in Philadelphia in 1996. The result was a win for Kasparov who won comfortably with a score of 4 to 2. 

While not the result Hsu had hoped for, he wasn't about to give up that easily. He heavily upgraded *Deep Blue* and challenged Kasparov to a rematch the next year.

So it was that Kasparov and Deep Blue were to go head to head in New York in 1997. The second match was much closer than the first. Of the six games in total, three of them ended in a draw.

There’s a urban legend that a bug in *Deep Blues* programming led to it making a random move in the 44th move of the first game. The move supposedly spooked Kasparov, who attributed it to superior machine intelligence. This led to him playing more cautiously for the rest of the tournament, which is attributed as a reason for *Deep Blues* victory. Who knows whether there’s any truth in this tale? No smoke without fire as they say.

While Kasporov won the first game handily, *Deep Blue* would go on to win the second. The next three games ended in a draw before *Deep Blue* won the sixth and final game.

Deep Blue's win was seen as symbolically significant, a sign that artificial intelligence was catching up to human intelligence and could defeat one of humanity's great intellectual champions.
 
 # From Chess to Go, and beyond: Hsus legacy
 I believe the triumph of machine over man in the game of chess is one of computer sciences greatest achievements. Hsu demonstrated to the world a new level of what computers are capable of. This no doubt lead to an increase in interest in AI and thus increased the level of research and funding being directed at AI. In my opinion, if it weren't for Hsus inspiring achievement, the field of artificial intelligence wouldn’t be as rich or advanced as it is today.  For instance, *Deep Blue* was a precursor to *AlphaGo*, the Google supercomputer that used machine learning to defeat the world champion of the ancient game of Go. Our world is full of artificial intelligence, thanks in no small part to one Feng-hsiung Hsu.
